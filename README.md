# Camp Website using PHP
This website is used by parents of campers in a sleepaway camp as a way to feel connected to their child who is away for the summer.
They will be able to view all the camp pictures from the week or fill out a form to send a message to their child. 
They can also view the staffsâ€™ contact information in case they need to be in touch with anyone about their child.

The messages for the campers are stored in a Mysql database and authorized users can view them on the website.
The parent can also contact the office, which will send an email to the office with the message.
